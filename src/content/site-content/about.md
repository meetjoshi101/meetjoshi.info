I’m a confident and results-driven software developer 💻 with over 3 years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications using Angular, Node.js, and SQL.

With experience across life sciences 🧬, oil & gas 🛢️, HR systems 👥, and developer tools 🛠️, I thrive in environments that demand creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. I’m not just focused on writing clean code — I’m always looking for innovative ways to solve real business challenges 💡.

As a team leader 🤝, I’ve successfully guided software development teams, delivering projects with precision while fostering collaboration and growth. I approach every project with clear strategic intent and the willingness to get my hands dirty — ensuring outcomes that are both technically sound and business-aligned ⚙️🎯.

I’m passionate about turning complexity into clarity. Whether it’s designing intuitive user interfaces 🎨, optimizing back-end systems 🔧, or leading high-impact sprints 🚀, I bring a strong blend of technical expertise, creativity, and business-first thinking.

Always learning, always building — I’m driven by the challenge of creating software that makes a real difference 🌱.
